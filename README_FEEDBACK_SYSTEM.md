# Feedback Analysis and Automatic Plan Adjustment System

## What is it?

This system allows users to provide feedback on their personalized plan and automatically **adjusts the plan** to better fit their specific needs. It's no longer just collecting feedback, but acting on it.

## How Does It Work?

### 1. **Smart Feedback Analysis**
The system analyzes the user's feedback text looking for specific keywords and patterns:

```javascript
// Examples of feedback the system understands:
"The exercises are too intense for beginners"
→ Automatically reduces exercise difficulty

"I don't have time to cook such complicated meals"
→ Simplifies the nutrition plan with quicker meals

"Professional goals are too ambitious"
→ Extends deadlines and breaks down goals into smaller steps
```

### 2. **Problem Detection by Categories**

#### 🏋️ **Fitness**
- `"too intense"` → Reduces intensity and duration
- `"boring"` → Adds more variety
- `"injury"` → Changes to low-impact exercises

#### 💼 **Professional**
- `"too ambitious"` → Extends deadlines and simplifies goals
- `"lacking skill X"` → Adds that specific skill to the plan

#### 🎨 **Hobbies**
- `"don't like X"` → Replaces with more appropriate alternatives
- `"more time"` → Increases time allocation

#### 🥗 **Nutrition**
- `"too complicated"` → Simplifies recipes and reduces prep time
- `"vegetarian/vegan"` → Adjusts for dietary restrictions

#### 💡 **Time Management**
- `"no time"` → Optimizes time management techniques
- `"overloaded"` → Reduces the general plan load

### 3. **Show Changes to User**

When adjustments are detected, the system:
- ✅ Shows exactly what will be changed
